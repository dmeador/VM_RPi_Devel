# WARNING: Do not include meta-yocto-bsp in your bblayers.conf.

# The variables you may want to customize are the following:
# 
#     MACHINE
#     TMPDIR
#     DL_DIR
#     SSTATE_DIR
# 		defaults are: 
# 		TMPDIR=~/rpi/build/tmp

# 		SSTATE_DIR=~/rpi/build/sstate-cache
# 
# The defaults for all of these work fine with the exception of MACHINE.

# MACHINE
# 
# The MACHINE variable is used to determine the target architecture and various compiler tuning flags.
# 
# See the conf files under meta-raspberrypi/conf/machine for details.
# 
# The choices for MACHINE are
# 
#     raspberrypi (BCM2835)
#     raspberrypi0 (BCM2835)
#     raspberrypi0-wifi (BCM2835)
#     raspberrypi2 (BCM2836 or BCM2837 v1.2+)
#     raspberrypi3 (BCM2837)
#     raspberrypi-cm (BCM2835)
#     raspberrypi-cm3 (BCM2837)
# 
# You can only build for one type of MACHINE at a time.

# You need to source the Yocto environment into your shell before you can use bitbake. 
# The oe-init-build-env will not overwrite your customized conf files.

source poky-rocko/oe-init-build-env ~/rpi/build

# I donâ€™t use any of those Common targets, but instead always write my own custom image recipes.

# You may occasionally run into build errors related to packages that 
# either failed to download or sometimes out of order builds. The easy 
# solution is to clean the failed package and rerun the build again.
